# Kepler-Planet-Classification
This is model that can predict exist exoplanet or not by features.

This model using Kepler Exoplanet Search Results dataset by NASA.
Now my algorithm using only 2 features of dataset, but soon it will be using maybe 20 or 30 features + synthetic data.
Also it will be using data visualisation and other things.

# I hope that my algorithm will be using by scientists and from all companies of the world!


As now, this project completely finished, because I've focused on more impornant task then that.
